<h2>About</h2>
<p>This was done over a break in summer 2022 while starting to take my
kids on college visits, then updated over winter break 2022-3 and
tweaked to update with new data; as I mention on the home page, while
there are lots of “College Ranking” websites, they use some odd factors
to rank (such as college administrators ranking each other, standardized
testing scores, how many students they reject, and more for <a
href="https://www.usnews.com/education/best-colleges/articles/ranking-criteria-and-weights">US
News and World Report</a>) while omitting things like tenure track
faculty numbers, library resources, climate, and whether the state safe
for LGBTQ+ students. The US federal data have information on lots of
schools: I chose to present info on all the schools that are still open
rather than filter for the schools just of interest to my family (my
kids are not going to seminary for a Masters degree or to a school for
funeral service directors any time soon, but this might be of interest
to students, staff, or faculty considering those schools, so I am
including them). Some schools, especially smaller ones (some have just a
few dozen students) do not include all information and so these school
pages might be sparse.</p>

an article</a> featuring this site and others that may be helpful for
you.</p>
<p><strong>If you have feedback on the site (corrections, good data
sources, etc.) please go <a
href="https://forms.gle/C9D7WXaMDVrTm3Z3A">here</a> (and thank
you!).</strong></p>
<p>There are two main types of pages on this site: one page for each
institution (over 4,000 of them) and pages of degrees offered by various
groupings of schools.</p>
<ul>
<li>The institutions have their individual data as well as comparisons
with “similar” schools, where similar is based on athletic conference
(for example, small liberal arts schools in Western Massachusetts), the
type of the school (i.e., is it a research intensive doctoral
institution). For metrics where one direction is better (lower cost is
good; more faculty is good) there is a ranking versus schools in the
comparison group. There are also line plots showing trends over time. If
a trend is “significant” (i.e., it is not likely to be due to random
chance, as assessed by fitting a linear model (and not correcting for
multiple comparisons)) then there is a column indicating the slope of
the trend.</li>
<li>The degrees pages show degrees awarded in different fields in the
most recent year available. There are many, many specific majors, so the
main groups are listed at [fields_overview.html] and you can then drill
down into the subfields.</li>
<li>This site historically has included social factors: gun control
laws, abortion laws, and more. Many students choose to go in state, but
a substantial number who consider out of state do <a
href="https://www.insidehighered.com/news/government/politics-elections/2024/10/14/survey-finds-students-base-college-decisions-state">look
at factors such as these</a> when deciding where to go to school. This
site is set up to be neutral, just presenting information on state laws
or other policies. However, as of this moment (end of 2024) there is
substantial uncertainty as to what will happen nationally – I am
concerned that any information here about state laws will quickly become
out of date as federal laws or policies change. I have thus, for now,
removed these factors so as not to inadvertently mislead anyone – please
go to advocacy groups for issues that matter to you to help learn about
policies in states you are considering.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="details-of-the-metrics" class="section level2">
<h2>Details of the metrics</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Acceptance</strong>: Percentage of undergraduate
applicants who are offered admission.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Yield</strong>: Percentage of people who, upon receiving
the offer of admission, choose to attend.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>First year retention</strong>: Percentage of
undergraduates who re-enroll in their second year. This can indicate
they adequately like the school and are receiving support they need to
be successful.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Transfer</strong>: Percentage of students who transfer
out from their bachelors program.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Graduation</strong>: Percentage of undergraduates who
graduate with a degree. Note that not all students enter an instiution
with this intent: someone could take a welding class at a community
college just to learn the skill without intending to get a degree in it.
That said, higher graduation rate is typically a good thing.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Undergrad enrollment</strong>: The number of
undergraduate students (typically those seeking an associates or
bachelors degree).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Graduate enrollment</strong>: The number of students
enrolled seeking a masters, PhD, or similar degree.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Degrees (of various kinds) awarded</strong>: How many
students got each degree from this college in a single year.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Undergrads per instructor</strong>: Undergraduate
enrollment divided by number of instructors. This does not mean the
typical class size: some instructors might teach four classes, others
just one; one class may have 300 students, and most others have just 10.
But generally one wants a lower number so that students have more access
to instructors.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Undergrads per tenure-track professor</strong>:
Undergraduate enrollment divided by the number of faculty on the tenure
track (both tenured and pre-tenure). Tenure helps protect academic
freedom: someone with tenure can be fired if they do not fulfill their
duties, commit misconduct, and so forth, but they cannot (easily) be
fired because the content of what they teach disagrees with what their
boss thinks, their research topic annoys a major donor, and so forth. A
lower number is better; the exceptions may be institutions where skilled
professionals who practice a subject (a musician, an actor, a painter,
and so forth) comes in to teach for a semester or a few years but with
the intent for it to be short term.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Average net price for students with
grants/scholarships</strong>: This uses federal data for what students
who are getting some sort of grant or scholarship pay <em>on
average</em>. There can be <em>huge variation</em> in this: some schools
charge far less for in-state than out-of-state students, some with large
endowments might charge students from less wealthy families nothing but
charge a lot to others, etc. It is possible that an Ivy league private
university could be cheaper for some students than their local
government-supported college (but far more expensive for other
students), but the average price does not reflect this. Thus, this may
be among the least useful items of information since it will not do a
good job predicting what your family will pay. This is only reported for
colleges that accept some federal support for students. Federal support
comes with various requirements (prohibition of some kinds of
discrimination, guidelines about handling of some kinds of alleged
misconduct, and more), so a handful of colleges reject all federal
support so they are not subject to one or more of these requirements. I
have included a comparison to Harvard, not because Harvard is
particularly expensive (its large endowment lets it award a substantial
amount of aid) but to help people realize that sticker price is not the
same as actual cost of attendance.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Tuition and fees</strong> as a source of core revenues:
What percentage of revenue comes from charging students. If an
institution relies substantially on this, it can have problems if
enrollment drops (it has fixed costs spread across fewer students, so it
has to make cuts, and so it may attract fewer students…).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Investment return</strong>: Percentage of income from
investments (stocks, bonds, and so forth). Provides a buffer, but not
all institutions have had wealth to build upon.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>State/Local appropriations</strong>: States, counties,
cities may choose to invest in their residents by supporting
institutions (more educated workforce, more practical skills, more
understanding of our world and its history, etc.).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Government grants and contracts</strong>: Faculty often
compete to get resources to support their work: a federal grant to study
the effect of wildfire on deer numbers, a state grant to develop new
algorithms to make self-driving cars more efficient, and so forth. These
can pay for staff, support students, buy materials, cover travel, and
more.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Private gifts, grants, and contracts</strong>: As above,
but also just donations of money or other gifts.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Location</strong>: Various location statistics.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Diversity among the faculty or students</strong>: This
uses data provided by the institutions, which is almost certainly based
on individuals’ self-reporting. The federal data only allows the given
racial/ethnic categories and only man or woman for gender. Most other
axes of diversity are not readily available. Note that people who are
not residents of the US fall into the “non-resident alien” for
race/ethnicity.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Notes</strong>: Individual institution pages may display
a note at the top of the page triggered by various conditions. They
contain explanatory notes when they appear. They are not necessarily
problems (for example, one thing that triggers is lack of data over
several years – that does not mean the school is doing poorly).</p></li>
